            <p>
              Amy Elder, owner and ASHA certified speech language pathologist at
              Full Bloom Speech Language Pathology earned both her undergraduate
              and graduate degrees from Ohio University in Athens, OH. She has
              been a licensed speech language pathologist since 2006 and
              specializes in pediatrics. She has worked in a variety of settings
              including public schools, private schools, home health, and
              private practice. Amy is passionate about helping children improve
              their communication skills to gain independence, confidence,
              achieve academic success, and make meaningful relationships.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              Amy enjoys including parents and caregivers in the therapy process
              to educate and empower caregivers on how they can help boost their
              child's speech and language skills at home during their daily
              activities. Amy believes that speech language therapy must be a
              collaborative, team effort which includes not only other
              professionals that may also be working with your child, but you,
              the parents. She has witnessed firsthand how powerful a "team
              approach" can be for making efficient progress towards meeting
              communication goals. Amy has extensive training and expertise with
              a variety of diagnosis including articulation, phonology,
              literacy, childhood apraxia of speech, developmental language
              disorder, late talkers, gestalt language processing, and pragmatic
              language.
