              Therapy sessions include direct treatment time and consultation
              with parents including carryover activities for home practice. We
              bill by the amount of time we spend with the child and the time we
              consult with the parent. Typically, our appointments are 45
              minutes; however, 30 and 60 minute sessions may be considered if
              deemed appropriate for the child.

              Most sessions are in our clinic space; however, occasional home or

              a travel fee will be included and agreed upon prior.
